# Typing Shapes
Which words have the most common shapes on the keyboard?


Inspired by [Matt Parker's video](https://youtu.be/Mf2H9WZSIyw?t=843), where he claims that typing the word _minimum_ is the maximum fun because of its shape on the keyboard, I set out to find which other words have that same shape. (For example, _minimum_ transposed one key to the left, gives _nubunyb_, but that's not a word.)

It turns out that no other word has the shape of _minimum_ :-(. In fact, most word shapes are unique.

So I set out to find the most common word shape on a Qwerty keyboard (for words of at least 4 letters).

### Results

Using the list of 466,550 words from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words , ignoring words with characters outside of A-Z (~11%), the most common shape had four instances:

1. Dede
1. Juju
1. Kiki
1. Lolo


### And what about Dvorak!?

_Minimum_ is still unique on Dvorak. But there was a shape with five occurences, and another with six.

1. Dada
1. Hoho
1. Lyly
1. Nunu
1. Sisi
1. Tete
